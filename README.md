 E-learning platform,
=======================

How to make a multiple choice quiz to test students:
------------

In order to update a quiz in this e-learning platform you need to set up a Google Spreadsheet.

Start a new Google Spreadsheet with the following column headers:

    question title	question text	right	right text	wrong	wrong text

(Don't sweat if you want to include extra goodies like images, videos, or additional titlesâ€”we'll get to that [later](https://github.com/motherjones/newsquiz#advanced-quiz)).

Write in all of your questions and answers. Want to include links? Stick anchor tags right in the cells.

In Google Docs, go up to the `File` menu and pick `Publish to the web`.


![Alt text](./src/images/publish-to-the-web.png?raw=true "Publish to the we")


Fiddle with whatever you want, then click `Start publishing`. A URL will appear, something like `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Arenb9rAosmbdG5GWHFXbWJlN1hTR2ZmN3lZMVZkOHc&output=html`

Copy that! In theory you're interested in the part between `key=` and `&` but you can use the whole thing if you want.
